# ASP.Net-Web-Site
In this project, I had the opportunity to add many pages by keeping the main integrity constant by using the master page structure. It contains many different content. (HTML/CSS/JS/JQ/C#) It was a long and detailed study. You can find many useful documents in it. It was made for commercial purposes.
